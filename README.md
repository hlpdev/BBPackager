## About
I am a developer for a somewhat popular game using Blitz3D and I got kind of sick 
of the usual Blitz3D crappy project organization and other annoyances, so I decided 
to make a package manager to clean up the style of Blitz3D projects as a whole.

BBPackager is an all-in-one Blitz3D project manager meant for games and other 3D
projects written in Blitz Basic.

## Usage
After installing BB Packager via our [releases page](https://github.com/hlpdev/BBPackager/releases/latest), the command
``bbpackager`` will be available via command prompt.

##### Checking the installed version
You can view the installed version of BB Packager by running ``bbpackager -v``

##### Viewing verbose logs
You can enable verbose logging ``bbpackager -l`` or ``bbpackager --verbose``

##### Compiling a debug output
You can compile the binary with debugging by running ``bbpackager -d`` or ``bbpackager --debug``

##### Initializing a project
You can initialize a basic project template by running ``bbpackager -i`` or ``bbpackager --init``

##### Compiling a project normally
You can compile a project by running ``bbpackager``

## Future Plans
I plan on implementing a fully fledged package manager into BBPackager in the near future!
